# Oculus project
Oculus is a web-based platform that provides personalized eye exercises based on a user's current eye health status. By analyzing user input and eye condition, the site recommends targeted routines to support and improve visual well-being.

This repository focuses on of the core components of the Oculus platform:
Strabismus Detection â€“ Using uploaded eye photos to automatically detect and classify strabismus into one of four types:

Esotropia (eye turns inward)
Exotropia (eye turns outward)
Hypertropia (eye turns upward)
Hypotropia (eye turns downward)

These functionalities serve as the foundation for personalized diagnosis and recommendation within the Oculus system.

The dataset was extracted from the Roboflow website: https://universe.roboflow.com/strabismus/strabismus-gjnif
